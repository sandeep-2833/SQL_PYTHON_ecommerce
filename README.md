The project "E-commerce Website Data Analysis using Python and SQL" involves analyzing sales, customer behavior, and product trends on an e-commerce platform. By leveraging Python for data manipulation and visualization (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) and SQL for querying the database, the project aims to extract insights about customer demographics, purchasing patterns, product performance, and sales trends. Key tasks may include cleaning and transforming raw data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating reports that provide actionable insights to improve business strategies, marketing efforts, and inventory management.
